CHANGELOG
=======

# 2020.XX.XX
- Minor internal updates to appease updated pylint/isort
- Add 3.9 to actions, update pins, try to behave like an adult :D

# 2020.07.04
- Disable ssh agent for now -- this will probably get supported/added in the future, but can cause hard to
 troubleshoot delays for now!
- Made transport timeout actually be used :)

# 2020.06.06
- First "real" release of scrapli_asyncssh -- still very early, but this has been working great in testing! Give it a
 shot!
